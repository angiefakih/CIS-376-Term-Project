This has the 'Sign Up' and 'Login' working on both mobile and web

The login page is that of Jad's

The home page after logging in is the default from before, not Angie's

All buttons on the home page lead to none functioning pages

When signing up, a message will tell you:
 - if the email is already used 
 - if the account was created successfully (sends to login page and
shows message)
 - if a field is missing

* Spamming invalid emails will no longer lock the database

When logging in, a message will tell you:
 - if the email/password is incorrect
 - if the log in is correct (it will log you in to the home page)

- The inputs clear when switching pages to/from Log in and Sign up

Messages clear when navigating back to the page

When a new message comes, the 5 second timer restarts
